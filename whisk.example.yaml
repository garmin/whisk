# This file describes how your project is configured. Any variables of the
# %NAME or %{NAME} will be expanded with the environment variable of the same
# name. In addition, the following variables will also be expanded:
#
#   %WHISK_PROJECT_ROOT  - The absolute path of the project root
#
# Whisk will fail if any undefined variables are encountered
#
# The version of this config file. Must be 1 or 2.
# Version changes:
#  2: No differences in the config file format. If this version is specified,
#     whisk will not define DEPLOY_DIR_<PRODUCT> variable aliases, since they
#     can cause problems if you product name happens to be an override
version: 2

# The location of the project root, relative to the parent directory of this
# configuration file. This value is evaluated before any variable expansion is
# done.  Defaults to ".", meaning that this config file is in the root of the
# project
project_root: .

# The location where the user's locally configured cache will be stored
cache: "%{WHISK_PROJECT_ROOT}/.config.yaml"

defaults:
  # The default values if the user has never configured before. If any are
  # omitted, the user *must* specify them the first time they configure. Note
  # that the default version is not configurable because it defaults to
  # "default".

# Shell code fragments that will be inserted into the shell code executed by

#   $WHISK_BUILD_DIR - The absolute path to the user specified build directory
#   $WHISK_INIT      - This variable will have the value "true" if this is the
#                     first time the environment is being initialized, and
#                     "false" if the user is re-configuring
